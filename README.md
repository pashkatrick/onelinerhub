## Why we do it and where we go
We're building non-profit opensource code hub, we address following issues:
- clear simple modern solutions for repeatable coding challeges
- moderated single-standard solutions instead of "here's a list of 25 answers with 125 comments"
- code parts explanations to fight dumb copy-paste, but educate instead
- no ads, no paid access, just community contributions and usefulness instead of profits 

## Principles
- 3 main principles for code pieces here are: simple, modern, minimal
- Micro solutions are ment to solve specific issue in **modern** versions of technologies (browsers, compilers, databases, etc.)
- Solution should be as short and simple as possible
- Solution should be explained by components (variables, functions, operations, etc.)
- Image illustrations are welcome
