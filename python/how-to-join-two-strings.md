# How to join two strings

```python
str = 'hi ' + 'all'
```

- `str` - will contain resulting string merged from two
- `'hi '` - first string to merge
- `'all'` - second string to merge
- ` + ` - if two strings are added in python, they are being concatenated (joined)

## Example: 
```python
str = 'hi ' + 'all'
print(str)
```
```
hi all

```

## Additional keywords
- concatenate
- merge
